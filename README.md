# Pipe down, Latinx

AS SEEN ON TWITTER: [@PipeDownLatinx](https://twitter.com/PipeDownLatinx)

A "simple" Twitter bot that tells @hayasaka_aryan to pipe down. Bro's not even a real Aryan, smh.

## How to use

1. Set up [twscrape](https://github.com/vladkens/twscrape), log in to Twitter and scrape the tweets. Put the accounts database in your working directory.
2. Get a Twitter Developer account and create a new app. Get the API keys and put them in `.env`
3. Run `cargo run --release` to start the bot.

I recommend running a cron job to run the bot every hour or so.
